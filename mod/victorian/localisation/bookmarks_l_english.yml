The German states are in unrest and want to be unified more than ever. Will it be Prussia or Austria that will take the leading role in this conflict? The United States is building up its nation adding more states on the west coast but on the east coast unhappiness is rising. Which empires will rise and write history? This is the Victorian Era."

There is a conflict of ideals within the region. In 1848 Denmark humiliated the German states. After the sparks of revolution raged over in 1848 Prussia adopted the first constitution. The coming years will be vital for the Prussian future. Will Prussia unite the German people under 1 leader or shall it be destroyed? War is coming. And in times of war we must protect ourselves!"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Viva la France! After the revolution in 1848 we are unstable. This nation is divided and needs a strong leader. Will we find one in Napoleon III? Or do we need to give the power to the people? France is a colonial power but it still stands in the shadow of the mighty British Empire. Is this the time France will restore its former glory like under Napoleon Bonaparte?"
